 <em><h3>Why BSc Creative Media?</h3></em>
Our programme delivers interdisciplinary teaching by crossing the boundaries among digital media, design, and computer science, which bridges creative and technical sides of computer-based media art production. Students will be trained in computer graphics, digital imaging, mobile media, user-interface (UI) and user-experience (UX) design, computer games and interactive media.

<em><h3>Our Target</h3></em>
This major produces creative media professionals who are proficient in computing technology. Students also gain a solid foundation in creative processes, including game design, user-interface and user-experience (UI/UX) design, animation, computer graphics, storytelling, video, sound, photography, installation and interactive digital media production.

This major combines core courses from the School of Creative Media and the Department of Computer Science to produce graduates who are able to bridge the gap between the technical and artistic sides of the media field. Graduates will be capable of using the latest computing and media technologies in the creation of various media including computer games, UI/UX, animation, special effects, sound, wireless and mobile media, internet application, virtual/augmented/mixed reality, and interactive installation.

<h3><em>Curriculum Structure</h3></em>

This major combines core courses offered by the Department of Computer Science and the School of Creative Media, providing students with a solid background in both areas. Students have the opportunity to mix with students in both academic units while developing teamwork skills and a true understanding of both fields.

Computer Science courses include computer programming, data structures, data storage, networking, applied algorithms, software engineering, computer graphics and AI game programming. These courses equip students with a solid background in computer science and programming, enabling them to develop software for the media industry.

<br>Creative Media courses include contemporary and new media art, computer animation, computer games, visual communication, installation, interactivity and creative media studio. These courses provide students with a good understanding of the creative process and the ability to produce content for digital media projects.

Through courses and final-year projects, students have ample opportunities to practise their technical and creative skills, work in teams and develop interesting digital media projects.

Students can also take free electives or minor(s) according to their personal or career interests to fulfil the credit requirement for graduation. A strong Student Advising Scheme is in place to provide essential guidance and mentoring to students as part of their study plan.
